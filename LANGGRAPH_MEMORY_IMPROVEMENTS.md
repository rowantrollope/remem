# LangGraph Memory Agent Improvements

## Overview
Enhanced the LangGraph memory agent to provide comprehensive user profiling and personalized assistance by improving prompts and extraction strategies for maximum effectiveness in learning about users.

## Key Improvements Made

### 1. Enhanced System Prompts

#### Before:
- Basic memory extraction focused on "valuable information"
- Conservative approach to memory storage
- Limited guidance on what to extract

#### After:
- **Comprehensive User Profiling**: Focus on building complete user understanding
- **7 Extraction Categories**: Personal identity, family, preferences, constraints, experiences, plans, behavioral patterns
- **Proactive Learning**: Extract from every meaningful interaction
- **Personalized Assistance**: Use memories to provide tailored help

### 2. Improved Memory Extraction Strategy

#### Enhanced Categories:
1. **Personal Identity & Context**: Name, age, location, occupation, lifestyle
2. **Family & Relationships**: Family composition, names, ages, preferences
3. **Preferences & Tastes**: Food, travel, entertainment, shopping preferences
4. **Constraints & Requirements**: Budget, time, health, accessibility needs
5. **Experiences & History**: Places visited, activities done, lessons learned
6. **Future Plans & Goals**: Upcoming events, aspirations, goals
7. **Behavioral Patterns**: Decision-making style, habits, communication preferences

#### Specific Extraction Triggers:
- Travel: "I've been to...", "I'm planning...", "My family of 4..."
- Food: "I'm vegetarian", "I love spicy food", "I'm allergic to..."
- Personal: "My wife/husband/kids...", "I work in...", "My budget is..."
- Preferences: "I always...", "I prefer...", "I hate when..."

### 3. More Aggressive Memory Collection

#### Changes:
- **Extraction Threshold**: Reduced from 2 to 1 (extract after every meaningful exchange)
- **Inclusive Evaluation**: Enhanced LLM evaluation to be more inclusive of valuable information
- **Expanded Keywords**: Added comprehensive keyword list for fallback detection
- **Comprehensive Context**: Updated default extraction context for complete profiling

### 4. Enhanced Question Answering

#### Before:
- Conservative, fact-only responses
- Strict confidence requirements
- Limited personalization

#### After:
- **Personalized Assistance**: Leverage user profile for tailored advice
- **Comprehensive Responses**: Connect multiple memories for complete answers
- **Context-Aware**: Consider family, budget, preferences in recommendations
- **Helpful Guidance**: Explain what additional information would improve assistance

### 5. New User Profile Summary Feature

Added `get_user_profile_summary()` method that:
- Searches across all memory categories
- Provides structured summary of user profile
- Groups memories by category (Family, Preferences, Constraints, etc.)
- Shows relevance scores and timestamps
- Helps users understand what the system knows about them

## Context Prompts for Different Scenarios

### Travel Planning:
```
"I am a comprehensive travel assistant. Extract user preferences, family details, budget constraints, past experiences, accessibility needs, and travel goals."
```

### General Assistant:
```
"I am a personal assistant building a complete user profile. Extract preferences, family information, lifestyle details, constraints, and personal context."
```

### Food/Dining:
```
"I am a dining assistant. Extract dietary restrictions, food preferences, family composition, budget, location, and dining experiences."
```

## Example Extraction Improvements

### Before (Conservative):
User: "I'm planning a trip to Europe with my family next summer"
Extract: "User is planning a trip to Europe"

### After (Comprehensive):
User: "I'm planning a trip to Europe with my family next summer"
Extract:
- "User is planning a trip to Europe next summer" (category: future_plans)
- "User has a family" (category: family)
- "User travels with family members" (category: travel_preferences)

## Benefits of Improvements

1. **Complete User Understanding**: System builds comprehensive profile of user preferences, context, and needs
2. **Personalized Assistance**: Responses tailored to user's specific situation, family, budget, and preferences
3. **Proactive Learning**: Captures valuable information from every interaction
4. **Better Recommendations**: Uses full user context to provide relevant suggestions
5. **Transparency**: User profile summary shows what system knows about them

## Usage Examples

### For Travel Planning:
- Knows family size for accommodation recommendations
- Remembers budget constraints for suggestions
- Considers past travel experiences and preferences
- Factors in dietary restrictions and accessibility needs

### For Restaurant Recommendations:
- Considers family composition and ages
- Remembers dietary restrictions and food preferences
- Factors in budget constraints and location
- Recalls past dining experiences and feedback

### For General Assistance:
- Understands user's lifestyle and constraints
- Remembers important dates and events
- Considers work schedule and personal preferences
- Provides contextually relevant suggestions

## Technical Implementation

- Enhanced prompts in `langgraph_memory_agent.py`
- Improved extraction logic in `memory_extraction.py`
- Better question answering in `memory_reasoning.py`
- New user profile summary functionality
- More inclusive evaluation criteria
- Expanded keyword detection for fallback scenarios

The system now provides a foundation for truly personalized AI assistance by comprehensively learning about users and leveraging that knowledge for tailored help.
