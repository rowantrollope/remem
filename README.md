    }
  ],
  "count": 1
}
```

#### 3. Answer Question (Advanced)

Answer questions using sophisticated confidence analysis and structured responses.

**‚≠ê This endpoint calls `memory_agent.answer_question()` directly for the highest quality responses.**

**POST** `/api/memory/answer`

**Request Body:**
```json
{
  "question": "What did I eat at Mario's restaurant?",
  "top_k": 5,
  "filter": "optional_filter_expression"
}
```

**Parameters:**
- `question` (string, required): Question to answer
- `top_k` (integer, optional): Number of memories to retrieve for context (default: 5)

### K-Lines API (Cognitive Memory Operations)

These endpoints implement Minsky's K-lines cognitive model for advanced memory operations, providing mental state construction and reasoning capabilities.

#### 1. Recall Memories (Mental State Construction)

Construct a mental state (K-line) by recalling relevant memories for a specific query or context.

**POST** `/api/klines/recall`

**Request Body:**
```json
{
  "query": "restaurant preferences for dinner",
  "top_k": 5,
  "filter": "optional_filter_expression",
  "use_llm_filtering": false
}
```

**Parameters:**
- `query` (string, required): Query to construct mental state around
- `top_k` (integer, optional): Number of memories to include (default: 5)
- `filter` (string, optional): Filter expression for Redis VSIM command
- `use_llm_filtering` (boolean, optional): Apply LLM-based relevance filtering (default: false)

**Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "query": "restaurant preferences for dinner",
  "mental_state": "Here's what I remember that might be useful:\n1. I prefer Italian restaurants with good pasta (from 2024-01-15 18:30:00, 95.2% similar)\n   Tags: restaurant, food, preferences",
  "memories": [
    {
      "id": "memory:550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000",
      "text": "I prefer Italian restaurants with good pasta",
      "score": 0.952,
      "formatted_time": "2024-01-15 18:30:00",
      "tags": ["restaurant", "food", "preferences"],
      "relevance_reasoning": "Directly relates to restaurant preferences for dining"
    }
  ],
  "memory_count": 1,
  "llm_filtering_applied": false
}
```

**LLM Filtering Enhancement:**
When `use_llm_filtering: true`, the system applies the same intelligent relevance filtering used in the `/ask` endpoint:
- Each memory is evaluated by an LLM for actual relevance to the query
- Only memories deemed relevant are included in the mental state
- Adds `relevance_reasoning` to each memory explaining why it was kept
- Response includes `original_memory_count` and `filtered_memory_count` for transparency

#### 2. Answer Questions (K-line Reasoning)

Answer questions using K-line construction and sophisticated reasoning with confidence analysis.

**POST** `/api/klines/ask`

**Request Body:**
```json
{
  "question": "What restaurants should I try for dinner tonight?",
  "top_k": 5,
  "filter": "optional_filter_expression"
}
```

**Parameters:**
- `question` (string, required): Question to answer
- `top_k` (integer, optional): Number of memories to retrieve for context (default: 5)
- `filter` (string, optional): Filter expression for Redis VSIM command

**Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "question": "What restaurants should I try for dinner tonight?",
  "type": "answer",
  "answer": "Based on your preferences, I'd recommend trying Italian restaurants with good pasta, as you've expressed a preference for this type of cuisine.",
  "confidence": "medium",
  "reasoning": "Your memory indicates a preference for Italian restaurants with good pasta",
  "supporting_memories": [
    {
      "id": "memory:550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000",
      "text": "I prefer Italian restaurants with good pasta",
      "relevance_score": 95.2,
      "timestamp": "2024-01-15 18:30:00",
      "tags": ["restaurant", "food", "preferences"],
      "relevance_reasoning": "Directly relates to restaurant preferences for dining"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Chat Application API

This endpoint provides a conversational interface using the LangGraph workflow for complex multi-step reasoning.

#### Chat Interface

**POST** `/api/chat`

**Request Body:**
```json
{
  "message": "What restaurants have I been to and what did I eat at each?"
}
```

**Parameters:**
- `message` (string, required): User message/question

**Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "What restaurants have I been to and what did I eat at each?",
  "response": "Based on your memories, you've been to Mario's Italian Restaurant where you had pasta carbonara. The LangGraph workflow analyzed your memories and found this information with high confidence."
}
```

**Key Differences from `/api/memory/answer`:**
- Uses full LangGraph workflow with tool orchestration
- Can perform multi-step reasoning and complex conversations
- More flexible but potentially higher latency
- Best for conversational UIs and complex queries

### System APIs

#### Health Check

**GET** `/api/health`

**Response:**
```json
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "service": "LangGraph Memory Agent API",
  "timestamp": "2024-01-15T18:30:00Z"
}
```

---

### Error Responses

All endpoints return consistent error responses:

```json
{
  "error": "Description of the error",
  "success": false
}
```

Common HTTP status codes:
- `400` - Bad Request (missing required parameters)
- `404` - Not Found (memory ID not found)
- `500` - Internal Server Error

```

---

## Developer Notes

### Memory vs Answer vs Chat

**Use `/api/memory/search`** when you need:
- Raw vector similarity search results
- Multiple memory candidates for further processing
- Building your own confidence analysis

**Use `/api/memory/answer`** when you need:
- High-quality question answering with confidence scores
- Structured responses with supporting evidence
- Single-step question answering

**Use `/api/chat`** when you need:
- Multi-step reasoning and complex conversations
- Tool orchestration and workflow management
- Conversational UI interfaces

### Performance Considerations

- `/api/memory/search`: Fastest, single vector search
- `/api/memory/answer`: Medium, includes LLM analysis for confidence
- `/api/chat`: Slowest, full LangGraph workflow with potential multiple LLM calls

### Memory Grounding

When `apply_grounding: true` (default), the system will:
- Convert relative time references ("yesterday", "last week") to absolute dates
- Resolve location context ("here", "this place") using current context
- Add people context based on current social setting

Set `apply_grounding: false` for raw memory storage without context resolution.

### Filter Expressions

The `filter` parameter supports Redis VectorSet filter syntax:

```bash
# Filter by exact match
"filter": ".category == \"work\""

# Filter by range
"filter": ".priority >= 5"

# Multiple conditions
"filter": ".category == \"work\" and .priority >= 5"

# Array containment
"filter": ".tags in [\"important\", \"urgent\"]"
```

### API Migration Guide

**Old API ‚Üí New API:**
- `/api/remember` ‚Üí `/api/memory`
- `/api/recall` ‚Üí `/api/memory/search`
- `/api/ask` ‚Üí `/api/memory/answer` (for structured responses) or `/api/chat` (for conversations)
- `/api/memory-info` ‚Üí `/api/memory` (GET)
- `/api/context` ‚Üí `/api/memory/context`
- `/api/delete/{id}` ‚Üí `/api/memory/{id}` (DELETE)
- `/api/delete-all` ‚Üí `/api/memory` (DELETE)

The new API provides cleaner, more RESTful endpoints with better separation of concerns between developer operations and chat applications.

## Configuration Management

The system now includes a comprehensive **Configuration Management API** that allows runtime configuration of all system components:

### Configuration API Endpoints

- **GET /api/config** - Get current system configuration
- **PUT /api/config** - Update configuration settings
- **POST /api/config/test** - Test configuration changes without applying them
- **POST /api/config/reload** - Reload configuration and restart memory agent

### Configurable Components

- **Redis**: host, port, database, vector set name
- **OpenAI**: API key, models, temperature, embedding settings
- **LangGraph**: model selection, temperature, system prompts
- **Memory Agent**: search parameters, grounding settings, validation
- **Web Server**: host, port, debug mode, CORS settings

### Example: Change Redis Server

```bash
curl -X PUT http://localhost:5001/api/config \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "redis": {
      "host": "redis.example.com",
      "port": 6379,
      "db": 1
    }
  }'

# Test the configuration first
curl -X POST http://localhost:5001/api/config/test \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"redis": {"host": "redis.example.com", "port": 6379}}'

# Apply changes
curl -X POST http://localhost:5001/api/config/reload
```

See [CONFIG_API.md](CONFIG_API.md) for complete documentation and examples.

### Testing

Run the test scripts to verify everything works:

```bash
# Test core memory functionality
python test_memory_agent.py

# Test configuration management API
python test_config_api.py
```

See `setup_redis.md` for detailed Redis setup instructions.
