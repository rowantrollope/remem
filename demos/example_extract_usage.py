    Agent: Welcome! How can I help you plan your trip today?
    
    Customer: Hi, we're planning a family vacation to Europe. It's me, my wife Sarah, 
    and our two kids - Emma who's 10 and Jake who's 8.
    
    Agent: That sounds wonderful! Tell me about your preferences.
    
    Customer: Well, I always prefer window seats when we fly - I love looking out at 
    the clouds. Sarah is vegetarian, so we'll need vegetarian meal options on the 
    flight and at restaurants. Our budget is around $12,000 for the whole family.
    
    Agent: Great! Any other preferences for the trip?
    
    Customer: The kids love interactive museums, especially science museums. Emma is 
    really into astronomy right now. We prefer staying in family-friendly hotels 
    with pools since the kids love swimming. Oh, and Sarah has a severe nut allergy, 
    so that's really important for restaurant recommendations.
    
    Agent: Perfect! When are you thinking of traveling?
    
    Customer: We're flexible, but sometime in July would be ideal. We want to avoid 
    the peak tourist season if possible to save money. Also, I should mention I have 
    mobility issues, so we'll need accessible accommodations and transportation.
