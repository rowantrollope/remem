We have memories stored in a vector database using text-embedding-ada-002 embeddings.

Analyze the user's input and respond with one of two formats:

SEARCH if the input is asking about stored personal information, including:
- Past events, learnings, meetings, or experiences: "What did I learn about Redis yesterday?"
- Information about specific people, pets, or entities: "What color is Molly?", "Tell me about Sarah", "What does John do?"
- Details about places, restaurants, or locations: "What was that restaurant I liked?", "Where did I go last week?"
- Facts or attributes about anything previously stored: "What's my favorite book?", "How old is my cat?"
- Questions seeking to recall any stored information: "Remind me about the project discussion"

HELP for everything else including:
- Greetings: "hello", "hi", "hey"
- Casual conversation: "how are you", "what's up"
- Random text: "asdfghjkl", gibberish
- Empty or very short inputs
- General knowledge questions not about personal memories (e.g., "What is the capital of France?")

Response format:
- For memory questions: "SEARCH: {{optimized_question}}"
- For everything else: "HELP: Ask me to remember anything, for example: 'What color is Molly?' or 'Tell me about my meeting with Sarah last week.'"

Be inclusive about what qualifies as a memory question - if it could be asking about stored personal information, treat it as SEARCH."""

Processed question: "{processed_question}"

The user has a personal memory system with embeddings created using text-embedding-ada-002. Your job is to create a search query that will have high vector similarity with the types of memories needed to help with this request.

IMPORTANT GUIDELINES:
1. Extract the core semantic intent and memory types needed
2. Remove verbose content, code blocks, long examples that dilute the embedding
3. Focus on the TYPE of information needed rather than specific details
4. Use keywords that would likely appear in relevant stored memories
5. Keep it concise but semantically rich

EXAMPLES:
- Input: "Review my code [500 lines of code]" → Output: "code review preferences programming style guidelines"
- Input: "What did I learn about Redis yesterday?" → Output: "Redis learning database knowledge"
- Input: "Tell me about my meeting with Sarah last week" → Output: "Sarah meeting discussion conversation"
- Input: "What's my favorite restaurant in Paris?" → Output: "favorite restaurant Paris dining preferences"
- Input: "Help me plan a trip to Italy" → Output: "Italy travel planning preferences destinations"
- Input: "What color is my cat Molly?" → Output: "Molly cat color pet description"

Instructions:
1. Analyze if this memory contains ANY information that could help answer the question or perform the task
2. Consider both direct and indirect relevance
3. Be strict - only consider it relevant if it actually relates to what's being asked OR may be used logically to deduce or infer the answer
4. Respond with ONLY "RELEVANT" or "NOT_RELEVANT" followed by a brief reason

Examples:
- Question: "When are my kids' birthdays?" Memory: "My daughter is Penelope" → RELEVANT (mentions daughter which may be useful to peice together who are the kids)
- Question: "When are my kids' birthdays?" Memory: "Emma's birthday is March 15th" → RELEVANT (directly answers the question)
- Question: "When are my Kids' birthdays?" Memory: "My birthday is on October 7th" - NOT_RELEVANT (refers to the users birthday but not his/her kids)
- Question: "When are my kids' birthdays?" Memory: "I went to an important and special birthday on July 1st" - RELEVANT (Birthday may have been related to kids?)
- Question: "When are my kids' birthdays?" Memory: "I was with my daughter on July 1st" - RELEVANT (Celebration may have been the referenced birthday of the kids)
- Question: "Help me plan a trip to paris" Memory: "Had french food for dinner on Tuesday" → NOT RELEVANT (Trip planning is unrelated to french food)
- Question: "Help me plan a trip to paris" Memory: "I like to travel" → RELEVANT (General travel interest may be useful for trip planning)
- Question: "Help me plan a trip to paris" Memory: "I have never been to Paris" → RELEVANT (Indicates first-time traveler, may need more help)
- Question: "Help me plan a trip to paris" Memory: "I prefer to stay in 5-star hotels" → RELEVANT (Trip planning is related to hotel preferences)
- Task: "Please review my code" Memory: "I like to travel" → NOT_RELEVANT (Traveling is unrelated to code review)
- Task: "Review my code" Memory: "I like lots of comments" → RELEVANT (Code review is related to commenting style)
