# Context-Aware Memory Extraction Fix

## üêõ **Root Cause Identified**

The context-aware approach wasn't working because there were **multiple code paths** calling `extract_and_store_memories` that weren't updated to use the new context-aware approach:

### **Problem Locations Found:**

1. **`web_app.py` line 1087** - Chat session memory extraction (the one in your log)
2. **`web_app.py` line 647** - K-LINE API endpoint  
3. **LangGraph agent** - Already fixed in previous update

### **The Issue:**
Your log showed duplicates being created because the chat session was using the **old approach**:

```python
# OLD CODE (causing duplicates):
result = memory_agent.memory_agent.extract_and_store_memories(
    raw_input=conversation_text,
    context_prompt=session.get('memory_context', '...'),
    apply_grounding=True
    # ‚ùå Missing: existing_memories parameter!
)
```

## üîß **Fixes Applied**

### **1. Fixed Chat Session Memory Extraction (`web_app.py` line 1087)**

**Before (causing duplicates):**
```python
result = memory_agent.memory_agent.extract_and_store_memories(
    raw_input=conversation_text,
    context_prompt=session.get('memory_context', '...'),
    apply_grounding=True
)
```

**After (context-aware):**
```python
# STEP 1: Search for existing relevant memories first
existing_memories = memory_agent.memory_agent.search_memories(
    latest_user_message['content'], 
    top_k=10, 
    min_similarity=0.7
)

# STEP 2: Extract with existing memories context
result = memory_agent.memory_agent.extract_and_store_memories(
    raw_input=conversation_text,
    context_prompt=session.get('memory_context', '...'),
    apply_grounding=True,
    existing_memories=existing_memories  # ‚Üê NEW: Context awareness
)
```

### **2. Fixed K-LINE API Endpoint (`web_app.py` line 647)**

Applied the same context-aware approach to the K-LINE API endpoint.

### **3. Added Enhanced Debugging**

Added comprehensive logging to track the context-aware process:

```
1) Searching for existing memories related to: 'I Wanna plan a trip to Italy...'
2) Found 10 existing relevant memories
üìö EXISTING MEMORIES PROVIDED: 10 memories
   1. User has 12 kids...
   2. All of User's kids are vegetarians...
   3. User wants to plan a trip to Paris...
‚úÖ PROMPT: Including 10 existing memories in extraction prompt
```

## üéØ **Expected Results After Fix**

### **Your Original Log Issue:**
```
Existing memories found:
- "User has 12 kids" 
- "All of User's kids are vegetarians"

But LLM still extracted:
- "User has 12 kids" (duplicate!)
- "Some of the user's kids don't eat meat" (duplicate!)
```

### **After Fix:**
```
Existing memories found:
- "User has 12 kids" 
- "All of User's kids are vegetarians"

LLM should extract:
- [] (no new information to extract)
```

## üîç **How to Verify the Fix**

### **1. Run the Test Script:**
```bash
python test_context_aware_extraction.py
```

### **2. Check Console Logs:**
You should now see:
```
üìö EXISTING MEMORIES PROVIDED: X memories
   1. User has 12 kids...
   2. All of User's kids are vegetarians...
‚úÖ PROMPT: Including X existing memories in extraction prompt
5) Identified 0 memories: (no duplicates extracted)
```

### **3. Manual Test:**
1. Say: "I want to plan a trip to Italy with my 12 kids"
2. Then say: "I want to plan a trip to Italy" 
3. Should extract 0 memories the second time

## üìä **All Code Paths Now Fixed**

‚úÖ **LangGraph Agent** - `langgraph_memory_agent.py` (fixed previously)  
‚úÖ **Chat Sessions** - `web_app.py` `_check_and_extract_memories()` (fixed now)  
‚úÖ **K-LINE API** - `web_app.py` `/api/klines/extract` (fixed now)  
‚úÖ **Tools API** - `tools.py` `extract_and_store_memories` (fixed previously)

## üéâ **Summary**

The issue was that while we implemented the context-aware approach in the LangGraph agent, the **web app chat sessions** were still using the old approach. Your log was coming from the chat session code path, which is why you were still seeing duplicates.

Now **all code paths** use the context-aware approach:
1. **Search existing memories first**
2. **Include them in the LLM prompt**  
3. **LLM only extracts NEW information**
4. **No more duplicates!**

The system should now properly prevent duplicates across all interfaces (LangGraph agent, chat sessions, and API endpoints).
