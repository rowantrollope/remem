    Customer: Well, I always prefer window seats when flying, and my wife is vegetarian so we'll need vegetarian meal options. Our budget is around $8000 for the whole trip. The kids love museums, especially anything with dinosaurs or science. 
    
    Agent: Great! Any other preferences?
    
    Customer: Oh yes, I have a bad back so I need aisle access, and we prefer staying in hotels with pools since the kids love swimming. Also, we're not into fancy restaurants - we prefer casual dining. My wife has a severe nut allergy, so that's really important for restaurants.
    
    Agent: Perfect, I'll keep all of that in mind. When are you thinking of traveling?
    
    Customer: We're flexible, but sometime in March would be ideal. We definitely want to avoid school holidays to save money.
